# Student_Performance_database
Student Database design and normalizing the database

# Background
This project presents a design for a student performance database that monitors student statistics, well-being, academic progress, extracurricular activities, and more. The database’s goal is to offer insightful information about the elements infuencing a student’s success. Studentinfo, P arentinfo,
StudentHealth, OverallAssessment, and Extracurricular are the fve tables that make up the database design. The database is in Boyce Codd Normal Form, and the tables are neatly organized with stated primary and foreign keys. Sample SQL queries, an ER diagram, and indexing advice are also included
in the document. Overall, the database design appears to be effective, simple to maintain, and will support the identifcation and resolution of the diffcult query problem.
